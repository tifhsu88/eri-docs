# Pulling images from the PlanetLab API
Necessary items to proceed:
[ ] **PlanetLab API key**: Your API key can be found on the Planet Lab website -> Login -> Click on **My Settings** tab -> Look for **API Key**

[] Download and open the planet_api_key notebook from our [Github](https://github.com/mrevanishere/ds-capstone-ERI/tree/main/notebooks_)


Once you have your API key and the notebook open, run through the code and replace your key in designated code chunk under the **Image Preparation** section.


Then, follow the instructions to add your GeoJSON as a dictionary in the **Query Parameters** section and run through the notebook. The output should be an image in a TIF format. 


The [next step](link to next step) will take you through the process of using Label Studio to annotate our images!
