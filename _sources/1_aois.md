# Finding AOIs

For our project, the Areas of Interest, or **AOIs**, are images of center pivots from across the world. We aim to compile a diverse dataset composed of center pivots varying in size and color to optimize the model performance. 

In order to pull images through Planet Labâ€™s API, we have to first specify the coordinates of the specified area. The file format we use is a *GeoJSON* file, which encodes geographic data features while maintaining non-spatial attributes. 

To begin accumulating coordinates in the GeoJSON format, navigate to [geojson.io](geojson.io). Then switch to satellite view and begin the search for center pivots! 

```{note}
Center pivots are generally located around bodies of water. Once you have located the area of interest, select the *rectangle* selection tool and outline the area. The coordinates should pop up on the right hand side. 
```
